The Hobbyt Text Adventure
=========================

[The Hobbit Text Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(1982_video_game))
was an early text adventure game developed by Veronika Megler and Philip Mitchell
and published in 1982 by Melbourne House, released initially for the ZX Spectrum,
and later the Commodore 64, BBC Micro and other home computers. 

This is an attempt at reimplementing the game in reasonably modern Python for today's computers.
Hence the name Hobbyt, a play on Hobbit + Python.
